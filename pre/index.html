    <h1>What Is It?</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>Project Sprouts is a highly cohesive, loosely-coupled collection of features that take some of the suck out of programming.</p>

    <p>Sprouts has been seen working on Mac, Windows and Linux and while it currently targets ActionScript, Flex and AIR development, tools can be easily created to improve any programming environment.</p>

    <p>Sprouts is a modular development platform that takes advantage of <a href="http://ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://rubygems.org">RubyGems</a> to share code generators, libraries, executables and automated build tasks. It runs anywhere Ruby does, including OS X, Windows, and *nix variants.</p>

    <h2 id="reasons">Why would someone use Sprouts?</h2>
    <p>There are lots of reasons to use Sprouts for your projects, here are some of mine:</p>
    <ul class="reasons">
      <li>Decouple builds from development tools</li>
      <li>Ensure that everyone on the team is using the exact same compilers, libraries and runtimes - by version</li>
      <li>Critical tools should be platform independent</li>
      <li>Avoid manually creating project files and folders over and over</li>
      <li>Avoid manually adding project dependencies over and over</li>
      <li>Avoid manually creating boilerplate classes, test cases and test suites</li>
      <li>Want to create new exploration projects with a single command</li>
      <li>Want to easily integrate projects with a Continuous Integration server</li>
      <li>Want to allow anyone on the project team to easily build the project</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Getting Started</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
    To get started with Project Sprouts, you'll need Ruby (>= 1.9.2), RubyGems (>= 1.3.7) and at least some interest in the programming language <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> and the build tool <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/rake.html">Rake</a>.
    </p>

    {% highlight bash %}
      # Install the ActionScript 3 / Flash Bundle:
      $ gem install flashsdk --pre

      # Generate a new ActionScript 3 project:
      $ sprout-as3 SomeProject

      # Move into the new project:
      $ cd SomeProject

      # Compile and run the main project:
      $ rake

      # Congratulations - you're up and running!
    {% endhighlight %}

    <p>
    To go a little further with Test-Driven Development:
    </p>

    {% highlight bash %}
      # Generate a class, test and test suite:
      $ sprout-class utils.MathUtil

      # Compile and run the test harness:
      $ rake test
    {% endhighlight %}

    <p>
    And finally:
    </p>

    {% highlight bash %}
      # Show available tasks:
      $ rake -T
    {% endhighlight %}

    <h1>Core Concepts</h1>
    <hr />

    <h2>Tools</h2>
    <p>A tool is any executable that has been distributed within, or referenced by, a <code>Sprout::Specification</code>.</p>

    <h2>Tasks</h2>
    <p>Sprouts takes advantage of the Rake build language, and brings the power of this language to non-Ruby programming environments.</p>

    <h2>Libraries</h2>
    <p>By using Sprouts, you can package shared code in source or compiled form and distribute it directly within a RubyGem or even refer to it at a different location on the internet. In either case, the library will be downloaded, cached, and made available to users of your project.</p>
