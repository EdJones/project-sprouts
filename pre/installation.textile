h3. Ruby Version >= 1.9.2?

It is especially critical that Windows users be running a Ruby that is greater than or equal to version 1.9.2. The previous versions of Ruby had critical bugs that prevented this version of Sprouts from working.

<a target="_blank" href="http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/">Ruby Version Manager</a> is a tool that makes it very easy to switch between different versions of Ruby. It also gets your system into a state where you don't use <code>sudo</code> to install RubyGems.

Be sure you have installed the OS X "Developer Tools" which should have been included with your operating system DVD.
