h1. Project Sprouts Version 1.0 Beta Released!

29 December, 2010 - Luke Bayes

After <a target="_blank" href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/asproject/">over 4 years</a> of thinking, rethinking, designing, implementing and reimplementing, I'm elated to announce the immediate availability of the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/lukebayes/project-sprouts/tree/master">Project Sprouts version 1.0 beta</a>.

This release is a nearly complete rewrite of every fundamental building block that was used in the past. We have decoupled, simplified, tested and documented just about every crevice. As you dig around and stretch it out, you'll likely notice areas that could use improvement. You may even stumble over an error or two. If you see anything at all suspicious (especially full-blown failures), please do <a target="_blank" href="http://groups.google.com/group/projectsprouts/">let us know</a>.

If you're working with ActionScript 3.0 or Flex projects, please check out this latest release. This release does _not_ include support for ActionScript 2.0 projects, and unless someone from the community contributes that functionality, it probably isn't going to get done.

While the new style of Rake tasks should be familiar to anyone using Sprouts 0.7, legacy Rakefiles will not run without modification.

If you're migrating a legacy Sprouts project, please check out the "migration guide":/2010/12/29/migrating.html.

We are also working hard to completely revamp our documentation using the <a target="_blank" href="http://yardoc.org/">Yard documentation engine</a>. 

We still have a handful of features that need some attention, so if you've been meaning to give back to an open-source project, this would be a great opportunity.

Check out our "developer guide":/2010/12/29/developer.html for more info on how to contribute.

This is also the inaugural post to the new Project Sprouts Blog! Be sure to subscribe to the "atom feed":/atom.xml so that you'll be notified whenever we post.
